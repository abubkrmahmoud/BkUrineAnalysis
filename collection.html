                                Urine should be examined immediately as much as possible after it is passed, because some urinary components are unstable. If urine specimen can not be examined immediately, it must be refrigerated or preserved by using different chemical preservatives. The maximum time that urinary contents to be maintained in urine specimen is one hour .<br>
