                 Urine has been referred to as a mirror which reflects activities within the
                  body. It has also been identified as presenting a biopsy of the kidney.
                   It is the principal route of waste removal of products of metabolism from 
                   the body .<br>

            <p class="para">  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examination of urine to diagnose a number of diseases is the oldest among
                tests in the history of Medical Laboratory Technology, It has been known 
                for centuries that abnormalities in urine may indicate disease. Perhaps,
                 one of the earliest known record of urine test was the technique of
                  pouring urine on the ground and observing whether or not it attracted 
                  insects, The attraction of insects indicates (honey urine) which was
                   known to be excreted by people with boils, Today checking sugar in urine
                    is a test to detect diabetes .</p>

                    day and only 2 liters of urine are excreted daily, urine is ultra filtrated

                     is reabsorbed in distal convoluted tubule and  collecting duct, The amount
